# Webscorer to HyTek Importer
Contains a script that can import Webscorer race seed results to a format parsable by HyTek. The script does no error checking and its output should be transparent to the input. Any errors should come from HyTek.

## Usage
```
python WebscorerToHytek.py --webscorer WEBSCORER_EXPORT --hytek OUTPUT_FILE
```
If `--hytek` isn't specified, the output will be `WEBSCORER_EXPORT_hytek.txt`.

## Python
This script requires Python 3.8 or later. If you need to install Python, use Miniconda.

## WEBSCORER FORMAT RULES:
1. Required keys are:
    - `Last name`
    - `First name`
    - `Gender`â€”only `Male` and `Female` are options ðŸ˜ 
    - `Team Name`â€”defaults to `Unattached`
    - `Team Code`â€”at most four characters, defaults to `UNA`
    - `Age`
    - `Email`
2. In Webscorer, event titles must be of the form
    `event_time/distance_metric/english_EVENTNAME`, eg. `event_time_metric_100m` or
    `event_time_english_1MILE` or `event_distance_english_LJ`.
3. `EVENTNAME` must be a valid event in HyTek. If this isn't the case, the HyTek
    import will throw some kind of error.
4. ~Event seed times must of the form `MM:SS`. Any number of characters before the first
    colon are interpreted as a number of minutes, and up to the next two characters
    after the first colon are interpreted as a number of seconds.~

## TODOS
- Add value character limits
- Add documentation
- Filter team code from team name. Assume space parenthetical format.
